# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > backup our code and save previous versions. also allows easy sharing.

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > mkdir is used to make a new directory inside of the current directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > things that do java script type of effecvt swithout javascript like hover and also maybe media queries

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > the more specific a css rule is the higher the priority it will take for overruleing other rules

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > you may important something for one instance and then need the other rules to be more immportant for another instance

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > with good design they are more likely to come back/ stay on your site and will be more likely to interact with it 

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > to help you have an idea of what your site will look like before you start bulding it

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > yes, because otherwise you will probably spend more time changing your code to change the website rather than just seeing what needs changed in the wireframe

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > determins wheather the flexbow will grow or shrink for extra space

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
